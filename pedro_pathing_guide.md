If you are unsure of how to program FTC, please refrence the code libary and FTC programming guide in the table of contents on the home page.

## What is Pedro Pathing

Pedro Pathing is a program for programing primarilly autonomous routines. This program was developed by Baron Henderson, 20077 Eclipse, 22131 Decode, Lucas Walker, 23856 Baconbots, and 10158 The Scott's Bots. This revolutionary program allows for much faster and more percise autonomous periods.

## Prerequsites
- You must have android studio installed. If you require a tutorial on how to use it, refrence the android studio tutorial in the table of contents on the home page.
- The robot must be omni-directional, which means either swerve or mecanum. However, mecanum is highly recommened, as it is signifacntly faster and easier to program.
- The robot must be equiped with drive encoders on all four wheels

## Setup
1. Clone the Baconbots Auto 25 project in android studio this link: https://github.com/lasersushi/BaconBotsAuto25.git
2. Update it to the latest version. The versions are outlined on this discord server(https://discord.com/invite/2GfC4qBP5s) in the releases channel. You can find the version in build.dependencies.gradle. If you require assistance accessing the server, contact lwalker30@priorypanther.com
3. Open up the teamcode folder, then java, then pedropathing. This is where you will be doing all of your programming. You may have noticed the constants file here. Open up the file. This is where the constants for your robot are stored.
4. Weigh your robot in kilograms, then change the mass under follower constants in the constants file accordingly.
5. Measure the robot and update the width and length in inches under drive encoder constants accordingly.

## Tuning
7. Deploy the code onto the driver hub. You plug the computer into the usb port, then transmit. If you wish to use wireless transmission, please contact lwalker30@priorypanther.com.
8. Open up the teleop process tuner, and follow the on-screen instructions accordingly to navigate to forward tuner and complete it.
9. Update the forwardtickstoinches multiplier in constants accordingly.
10. Repeat the same process for these following tuners in this order: lateral tuner, and turn tuner.
